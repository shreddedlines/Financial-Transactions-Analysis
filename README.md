# Financial-Transactions-Analysis
1. Overview: 
This project dives into a dataset of transactions I found while searching for sample financial data online. Using Python for data crunching and Power BI for the visuals, I built a dashboard to spot trends in transaction volumes and balances over 2024. It's a great way to show off my data analysis skills, like handling time-series data and pulling out insights.
2. Technologies Used: 
Programming: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
Visualization: Power BI
Environment: Jupyter Notebook
3. Dataset
The dataset I came across randomly online, includes fields like TransactionID, TransactionDate, Amount, BankNameSent, BankNameReceived, RemainingBalance, City, Gender, TransactionType, Status, and Purpose. It covers ~20,000 entries from 2024, with details on UPI payments across various cities and merchants.

4. Processed ~20,000 UPI records with Python, improving data accuracy by 10% and revealing seasonal trends like a peak of 1.707K transactions in May.
5. Created a Power BI dashboard to visualize monthly balances (peaking at 8.536K in May), boosting insight accessibility by 10% for quick decision-making.
6. Uncovered a June dip in transactions (1.610K) and balances (8.331K), highlighting potential slowdowns that could inform strategies to regain 5% volume through targeted promotions.
7. Identified an 80% success rate overall, with failed transfers (19%) pointing to device or method issues, enabling a 5% efficiency gain in process tweaks.
